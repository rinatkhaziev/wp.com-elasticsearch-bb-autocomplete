WordPress.com REST API Elasticsearch Autocomplete with Backbone.js and Underscore.js
====================================================================================

Backbone.js autocomplete for WordPress.com REST API Elasticsearch.

The code is heavily based on [Backbone.AutoComplete](https://github.com/fatiherikli/backbone-autocomplete)

Current implementation is just an extraction from one of the projects I've been working on. It might work out of the box but probably will require some tinkering on your side.

This code is an implementation for wordpress.com Elasticsearch setup but can be modified to work with any ES integration easily.
